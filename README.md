Ⅰ. Problem to be solved

There is a town nearby Antarctica drought constantly happens, and residents need to drive to a well to get water. Residents often drive their trucks and use several sizes of cylinder containers to transfer water. This calculator aims to help town residents do the essential calculation and assist them to make the decision on water transportation. The trucks can usually bear a load of 360 kg. The radii of cylinder containers vary from 0.2m to 0.4m, and the heights of container range from 0.5m to 0.7m. The difference between the value of radii is 0.1 m, and the difference between heights is also 0.1m. In this scenario, the water in each cylinder must be full. Additionally, the mass of driver, the mass of cylinder containers, and other objects on the truck are not included in the maximum load. The discussion and calculation will only focus on the water mass. 

Ⅱ. Purpose

This calculator will calculate the maximum volume of each cylinder container, the water mass in each cylinder container, total water mass, and the number of cylinder containers needed. It also ensures the total mass of water doesn’t exceed the maximum load of truck. The assumption states that at least one and at most five cylinder containers will be used to transfer water without exceeding the maximum load.
